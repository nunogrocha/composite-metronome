# composite-metronome

After looking for something that could loop measures with different time signatures and not finding anything that could do so, I've decided to build it. That's when I came up with the "Composite Metronome" idea.

#[Live Demo](http://composite-metronome.rhcloud.com/)

Using [HTML5 Web Audio AudioContext](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/) & [web-audio-scheduler](https://github.com/mohayonao/web-audio-scheduler) I loop different time signatures and subdivisions. 

[Angular Js](https://angularjs.org) and [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org) were used to create the interface.
